📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
🔥 Project Title
EDA on Product Dataset: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization

📌 Introduction
This project presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, covering data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization to extract meaningful insights from a product dataset.
It is divided into three main parts:

Data Cleaning

Data Analysis

Data Visualization

The project demonstrates how a raw dataset is transformed into actionable insights for business decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives
Understand and explore the dataset structure.

Clean and preprocess the data for quality improvement.

Identify relationships, trends, and anomalies.

Visualize data for better interpretation.

Summarize key insights and findings.

🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about various electronic products (such as smartphones, tablets, wireless devices, etc.). It covers multiple aspects of each product to enable a comprehensive analysis.

The main features included are:
Brand Name:
The company or manufacturer of the product (e.g., Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, etc.).

Product Name:
Specific model name or series name to uniquely identify each product.

RAM:
The amount of Random Access Memory available in the device (e.g., 4GB, 6GB, 8GB).

Internal Storage:
The amount of built-in storage capacity (e.g., 64GB, 128GB, 256GB).

Expandable Storage (if applicable):
Whether the storage can be expanded using a memory card and its maximum supported size.

Display Size:
The size of the product screen in inches (e.g., 6.5 inches, 10.1 inches).

Battery Capacity:
Battery power measured in mAh (milliamp hours) — available if provided.

Camera Specifications:
Details about front and rear cameras (e.g., 12MP Rear Camera + 8MP Front Camera).

Processor Type:
Information about the chipset or processor used in the device (e.g., Snapdragon 888, MediaTek Helio G95).

Operating System (OS):
The software platform running on the device (e.g., Android 13, iOS 16).

Price:
The selling price of the product listed on the platform, in INR (₹) or USD ($).

Ratings:
The average customer rating of the product (e.g., 4.2/5 stars).

Number of Reviews:
Total number of customer reviews submitted for the product.

Offers and Discounts:
Information regarding any available discounts, EMI options, or special offers.

Other Attributes:

Network connectivity options (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi only)

Color variants

Warranty details

Product availability status (In stock, Out of stock)

📌 Important Note:
Some attributes might have missing values that were cleaned during the Data Cleaning phase.

Certain features like "Battery Capacity," "Processor Type," or "Offers" might not be consistently available across all products.
