📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
🔥 Project Title
EDA on Product Dataset: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization

📌 Introduction
This project presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, covering data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization to extract meaningful insights from a product dataset.
It is divided into three main parts:

Data Cleaning

Data Analysis

Data Visualization

The project demonstrates how a raw dataset is transformed into actionable insights for business decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives
Understand and explore the dataset structure.

Clean and preprocess the data for quality improvement.

Identify relationships, trends, and anomalies.

Visualize data for better interpretation.

Summarize key insights and findings.

🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset contains product information such as:

Brand Name

Specifications (RAM, Storage, Display Size, etc.)

Price

Ratings and Reviews

Other Attributes

(Update the above list depending on your dataset if needed.)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas — Data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy — Numerical operations

Matplotlib — Basic data visualization

Seaborn — Advanced visualizations

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🧹 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Checked and handled missing values

Removed duplicate entries

Standardized inconsistent formats

Cleaned and extracted key features from raw data

📁 Notebook: EDA - Final file -2 Data Cleaning.ipynb

2. Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis (individual features)

Bivariate Analysis (relationship between two features)

Multivariate Analysis

Correlation Matrix

📁 Notebook: EDA - Final file -1.ipynb

3. Data Visualization
Bar charts, Pie charts, Histograms

Heatmaps to show feature correlations

Scatter plots and box plots

Brand-wise and price-wise comparison

📁 Notebook: EDA - Final file -3 Visualization.ipynb

🔎 Key Insights
[✔️ Insight 1: Example: Brand X dominates with 40% market share.]

[✔️ Insight 2: Example: Devices with higher RAM tend to have higher ratings.]

[✔️ Insight 3: Example: There is a significant price gap between premium and budget brands.]
